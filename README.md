# Intro Machine Learning Models

This project is an introduction to building machine learning models.

Various polynomial regressions were trained and tested on a training and testing data set.

The training data was used to implement L2-regularization of the 4th order polynomial regression.

The regularization parameter (lambda) was varied, the training/testing errorwas plotted in order to determine the best lambda to fit the data.

I also wrote a procedure that performs five-fold cross-validation on the training data which was  used to determine the best value for Î».
